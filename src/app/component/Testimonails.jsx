They took the time to explain how the rebate worked, what I was eligible for, and helped me choose the right system for my home â€” no pushy sales talk, just solid advice. Thanks to the VEU rebate, I only had to pay for the installation, which made the whole thing super affordable. The installation team arrived on time, worked efficiently, and were really respectful of my home. Everything was set up smoothly, and they took the time to walk me through how to use the system before they left. The system itself has been working perfectly â€” it's quiet, powerful, and keeps the whole house comfortable in minutes. Another big plus: CureGreen provided all the necessary compliance certificates â€” including the Victorian building certificate, electrical safety certificate, and plumbing compliance certificate. It gave me peace of mind knowing everything was done properly and to standard. Honestly, if youâ€™re looking to upgrade your heating and cooling, Iâ€™d definitely recommend CureGreen. Professional service, top-quality installation, and serious savings with the rebate â€” it was a great decision! Like",
